# CamLab-SLM-Alignment

VB.NET code to manually control SLM connected to PC via HDMI. Mostly intended for fine-aligning a displayed Fourier hologram with a multimode fibre to subsequently measure a transmission matrix or excite discrete modes in the fibre. Allows Zernike polynomials to be manually adjusted, and both blank and custom holograms to be displayed.

Originally built to work with a Jasper SLM, but should work with other nematic liquid crystal SLMs just by changing the expected SLM resolution.
